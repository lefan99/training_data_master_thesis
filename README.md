The data train is labled as followed:

atomic number , net magnetic moment, electro negativity  , number of atoms per unit cell  (then repeating for the second element)
volume of the unit cell, d1 , f1, d2,f2,s1,p1,s2,p2

d1 refers to the d orbital occupation of the first element. d2  of the second element. etc....
